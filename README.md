# Google Extension disable YouTube 2x

Extends YouTube’s default playback controls by removing the “hold to 2x speed” shortcut so you can focus on watching without accidental speed changes.

## Features

- Disables the 2x speed acceleration gesture that appears when you long-press the playback controls.
- Keeps the rest of YouTube’s interface untouched so you still benefit from its native layout.
- Lightweight and privacy-friendly—no network calls or tracking.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and point to this project folder.
4. Refresh YouTube to activate the new behavior.

_This extension will soon be submitted to the official Chrome Web Store for easy installation via the store catalog._

## Usage

- Once loaded, the extension works automatically—no buttons or settings required.
- To test changes during development, edit `content.js`, reload the extension, and refresh any open YouTube tabs.
