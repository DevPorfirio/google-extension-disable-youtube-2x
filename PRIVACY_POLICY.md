# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection
This extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information, usage metrics, or behavioral data. The code runs entirely locally in your browser and only modifies YouTube's playback interface to disable the "hold to 2x speed" gesture. No server communication is involved.

## Permissions
The extension requests only the permissions it needs to interact with YouTube's DOM. Those permissions are declared in `manifest.json` and are used strictly to identify the playback controls so the feature can be disabled.

## Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party analytics, logging, or remote configuration services. All logic executes client-side, and no requests are made to external APIs outside of the standard YouTube asset loading.

## Data Sharing
Since no data is collected, there is nothing to share with anyone. Your browsing data remains private.

## Updates
Any updates to this policy will be reflected in this repository. For the latest information, refer to this file before installing or publishing the extension.
